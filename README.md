## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended: 20+)
- pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun
- PostgreSQL database (local or cloud)
- Clerk account (for authentication)
- Anthropic API key (for AI model)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anayatkhan1/agentkit-starter.git
cd agentkit-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section below).

4. Set up the database:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate

# Run database migrations
pnpm prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

To run the project locally, you need to set up the following environment variables. Create a `.env.local` or `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/chat
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/chat

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/agentkit

# Anthropic AI
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

# Optional: Production URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Getting API Keys

- **Clerk**: Sign up at [clerk.com](https://clerk.com/) and create a new application. Copy your publishable key and secret key from the dashboard.
- **Anthropic**: Get your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Use a local PostgreSQL instance or a cloud provider like [Neon](https://neon.tech/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), or [Vercel Postgres](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres).

## Database Setup

This project uses Prisma as the ORM with PostgreSQL. The database schema includes:

- **Chat**: Represents a conversation thread with user ID, title, and timestamps
- **Message**: Represents individual messages in a chat with role, content (JSON), and timestamps

### Running Migrations

After setting up your `DATABASE_URL`, run:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
pnpm prisma generate

# Create and apply migrations
pnpm prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) View your database in Prisma Studio
pnpm prisma studio
```

```

## Usage

### Web Search Toggle

The chat interface includes a search toggle button. When enabled, the AI agent will use web search to find current information. When disabled, the agent responds using its training knowledge only.

### Chat Persistence

All conversations are automatically saved to PostgreSQL. Each chat is associated with a user ID (from Clerk), allowing for user-scoped chat history. Chats are loaded automatically when you navigate to a chat page.

### Customizing the Agent

You can customize the AI agent by:

1. **Modifying the system prompt**: Edit `src/agents/web-search-agent/prompt.ts`
2. **Adding new tools**: Create tools in `src/tools/` and integrate them in the agent
3. **Changing the AI model**: Update the model in `src/agents/web-search-agent/agent.ts` or `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
